RULES

Guess the phrase before Hangman gets hung!

Enter an alphabet you think that is a part of the answer.

If your guessing letter is correct, the blank will be replaced with the letter.

If your guessing alphabet is incorrect, Hangman will be drawn step by step.

Hangman has FIVE tries before hung, in which, you will lose the game.

Good luck!!
