ABOUT THIS APPLICATION

This is designed to be used to be a repository for notes taken during "Quiet Time"
as known as Bible study.  The books that are populated are the standard King James
version books.  

NOTE:  Verses are not verified or confirmed.  This is up to the user to make sure
       the correct verses are used in the note taking.

To backup the notes, simply save the notes.txt from the folder with the .jar file.

To restore notes, copy the backup version of notes.txt into the folder with the
.jar file with the application closed.

The original concept of this application was originally built for the Charleston 
Southern University class CSCI 325 by Professor Julie Henderson.

Then the GUI was built and there was a revamp of all the code including dozens 
of additions for this free release version.

Copy of this code without the content of the Authors is prohibited.
